<h1>Aminopropanediol (APD) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>Aminopropanediol (APD) market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 63 million in 2024 to USD 98 million by 2032</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.1% during 2025â2032</strong>, according to a comprehensive market analysis. This growth trajectory reflects rising demand for APD as a critical intermediate in pharmaceutical contrast agents and agricultural pesticides globally.</p><p>Aminopropanediol (chemical formula C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>) has emerged as a specialty chemical backbone for medical imaging and crop protection solutions. Its synthesis through ammonolysis of 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol creates a versatile compound that balances reactivity with stability â properties making it indispensable across healthcare and agriculture sectors.</p><p><strong>1. Diagnostic Imaging Revolution:</strong><br>
With over <strong>80 million CT scans</strong> performed annually in the U.S. alone, APD serves as the precursor for 72% of non-ionic contrast agents like iohexol. The radiology contrast media market's <strong>7-9% annual growth</strong> directly feeds APD demand.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
