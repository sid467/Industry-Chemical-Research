<h1>Global Non-Wood Fiber Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>non-wood fiber market</strong> is projected to grow significantly from <strong>2024 to 2030</strong>, driven by increasing environmental concerns about deforestation and the rising demand for sustainable alternatives in papermaking and textiles. This growth reflects a broader shift toward eco-friendly materials as industries seek to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining product quality.</p><p>Non-wood fibers, derived from agricultural residues and natural plants like <strong>bamboo, straw, and bagasse</strong>, are gaining traction as viable alternatives to traditional wood pulp. These fibers offer comparable durability and versatility while addressing sustainability concerns, making them essential in industries looking to meet regulatory and consumer-driven environmental standards.</p><p>Governments worldwide are implementing stricter regulations to curb deforestation, with the <strong>EU's Deforestation-Free Products Regulation (EUDR)</strong> set to reshape supply chains by 2025. This has accelerated investments in non-wood fiber production, particularly in regions like <strong>Asia-Pacific and South America</strong>, where agricultural byproducts are abundant.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
