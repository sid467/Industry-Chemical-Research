<h1>Lilial Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032: Supply and Demand analysis, Regional Analysis and Competitive</h1><p>The global <strong>Lilial market</strong> is poised for steady growth, projected to expand from <strong>USD 227.10 million in 2023 to USD 334.60 million by 2032</strong>, representing a <strong>CAGR of 4.40% during 2025–2032</strong>. This synthetic aromatic aldehyde, chemically known as butylphenyl methylpropional, remains strategically important for fragrance formulations despite increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Lilial's signature floral scent profile makes it particularly valuable for <strong>high-end perfumes, household cleaners, and personal care products</strong>. However, the market landscape is shifting as regulatory pressures reshape formulation strategies across Europe and North America.</p><p><strong>1. Premium Fragrance Demand Offsets Regulatory Pressures:</strong><br>
While the EU's 2022 restriction on lilial in cosmetics impacted certain segments, the compound continues finding robust demand in <strong>luxury perfumery and household applications</strong>. The global fine fragrance market, growing at <strong>5.2% annually</strong>, still utilizes lilial in markets without regulatory constraints, particularly in Asia and the Middle East.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
